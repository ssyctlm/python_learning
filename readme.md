## About me
I am a person who has been eager for learning coding for years but hasn't put it in an active. Until in my mid 30 years age, I felt I have to do something before it's too late.

## Difficulties
However, it's truly difficult for a mid age people who works in China.
* I have too many works to do in my position, sometimes I need to overwork, and when I get home I always feel too tired to concentrate.
* I learn python by using an Iphone associate with a kindle in which circumstance it would cost me more obstacles than expect.
* Don't have a good memory to remember everything
* Don't have enough basic knowledge about computer science

## What I will do here
* Overcome all difficulties above, and become a progammer in the future
* To record some interesting scripts or tricky pracitices
* To save some learning notes here
* To encourage myself to persuit my dream
